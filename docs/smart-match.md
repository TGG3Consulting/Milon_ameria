# Smart Match

Smart Match links an unstructured bank payment purpose to structured Bitrix deal fields. The
production objective is precision first: returning no suggestion is safer than attaching a payment
to the wrong deal.

## Runtime

Set `SMART_MATCH_V2=true` to enable all of the following together:

- the V2 purpose parser;
- Unicode-aware matching and source spans;
- structured project/apartment/floor/area evidence;
- name matching with safe full-name token reordering;
- conflict vetoes, including an explicit apartment mismatch.

The flag defaults to `false`, so existing deployments keep legacy behaviour until shadow results
have been reviewed.

## Decision ladder

The matcher stops at the strongest successful level:

| Level | Confidence | Use |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| raw exact | 1.000 | Same source text and case |
| normalized | 0.950 | NFKC, case, whitespace, dash/slash and leading-zero variants |
| name token exact | 0.925 | Same complete name tokens in another order |
| anchored regex | 0.800-0.900 | Typed Armenian/Russian/English field anchors |
| fuzzy text | 0.500-0.750 | Bounded Damerau-Levenshtein/OCR tolerance |

Fuzzy matching is structurally disabled for numeric identifiers. Runtime deal evidence also asks
numeric fields to have their semantic anchor, so a bare `55` cannot become apartment 55 merely
because it appears as an amount or reference number.

A deal needs multiple independent signals, such as project + apartment or apartment + payer name.
A common project alone is insufficient. If both sides explicitly contain different apartment
numbers or different known projects, the candidate is rejected.

`smartFindBest()` compares candidate identities and requires a confidence margin. Equally strong
different candidates return `null`; leading-zero aliases of the same numeric identifier do not
create false ambiguity.

  equivalence. Canonicalization is cluster-aware so decomposed sequences preserve correct spans.

## Validation and rollout

Run:

```bash
npm.cmd test
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
node apps/server/src/tools/shadowCompare.js
node apps/server/src/tools/shadowCompare.js --live --limit 200
```

The live shadow command is read-only. Review false positives and CRM structured-field coverage
before enabling the flag in production.
